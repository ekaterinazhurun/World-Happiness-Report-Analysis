# World-Happiness-Report-Analysis
This project analyzes the data from the World Happiness Report (2016 - 2020) to find out what factors affect one's happiness the most. 

With everything what happened in 2020 and everyone talking about happiness and the importance of mental health, I was very curious to see what are the 
factors that influence our happiness and what are the happiest places on Earth. 

My first assumption when I started analyzing the dataset was that the 'Freedom to Make Life Choises' variable would be the most determining one. 

Please see the presentation to find out if I was correct or not ;)
